# April Fool's Hack Prank

This is a harmless April Fool's prank that displays a fake hacking screen on the victim's computer. It's completely safe and doesn't perform any actual hacking or system modifications.

## How to Use

1. Host these files on a web server or use a local server
2. Share the link with your friends/colleagues on April 1st
3. Watch them panic briefly before the "April Fools!" message appears

## Deployment Options

### Local testing
- Use a tool like Python's HTTP server: `python -m http.server` from the project directory
- Open `http://localhost:8000` in a browser

### Sharing with others
- Upload to a free hosting service like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel
- Create a QR code that points to your hosted page
- Send the link with a compelling reason to click (e.g., "Check out this security update")

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `hackingSequence` array in script.js to customize the commands and messages shown during the "hack."

## Important Notes

This is meant to be a harmless prank. Use responsibly and only with people who will appreciate the humor!
